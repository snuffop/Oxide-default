Proxmox templating request: moving forward let's standardize on 80GB root partition and any other disk sizing requests are for a /data partition. And while I know it doesn't matter, it freaks certain people out, it would reduce the amount of explaining and handholding if /boot and /boot/efi partitions were the first ones rather later. So folks believe that the virtual disk partitions work like spinning rust and there are actual sector boundary and blocks such that if root is /dev/sda1 and /boot is /dev/sda2 that you can't expand /dev/sda1. AFAIK that's not true.
