## Seizure Record

### 2012

#### April 2012

##### Jazz Started having seizures about 3 months after moving to San Antonio. We started Keeping records in the cell phone and gave a print out to STVS.  Since then the phone has changed, the info is in the cloud.  This continuing record started April of 2014

#### 04/29 12 Sunday

     At 12:32 AM he had a mild seizure lasting less than a minute. He foamed at the mouth and peed himself. Body went ridged and came out very out soon after with full recognition. Was very hyper for about 45 minutes and then went back to sleep for the rear of the nite. They were left home alone for about 4 hrs the previous day. That day jazzy was hyper active all day and dominant with Sydney.

#### 05/02/12 Wednesday

     23:42 Gran mall seizure.Short but strong. Legs were running,foaming at the mouth, peed himself and this time his mouth was working overtime.

#### 6/04/12 Monday

     Around 5:50 AM a seizure hit while jazz was sleeping. Lasted about a minute. For a change we were close enough to physically grab him and stop him from hurting himself and it seemed like he came out if sooner. In hindsight Jazz was more assertive with Sydney yesterday. Right now after the fact the usual hyperness. We went outside he did his number 2. Now he calming down and noticing a drag on ( wanna say) his rear feet. Hear the claws dragging a bit when he's walking around.

#### 6/09/12

     7:35 AM another seizure. The is diff in the way that it happened during day time hours. Not sure if he was awake when it hit cause we were sleeping in(being Saturday morning)Thinking maybe he was but can't be sure. Classic seizure otherwise.

#### 6/10/12

     9:14 AM not sure if he was sleeping or not when it hit. Took about a minute. This time he was almost bouncing his head of the floorAlthough he was a lil spooked and disoriented for another minute or so after he was back on his feet. While later all we could do to keep him out of the garbage. Took 40 min for the adrenalin to be worked off.Took til almost 12 hrs later for him to be completely calm.

#### 7/05/12

     6:35 AM
     Not sure if he has one or not. Seems to be showing sigma of having one. Was let out in the morning after getting up for about 10 minutes. After coming on he was a hyper and unresponsive to commands. As well has dragging his back foot and a slobbers beard.

#### 7/05/12

     10:02 AM
     Medication was on time about 3 minutes earlier Witnesses the start of the seizure. He was stand by the food bowl and tensed up to his left side, head up at an odd angle and started to see the shaking to start. Got up and layed him down easy so he wouldn't hurt himself. Was intense but short. Felt his heart race and tense up all over the place. Mouth was held in an open position. Paws were flailing. lasted about 30 seconds

#### 7/06/12

     12:44 AM

#### September 30, 2014 3:38 AM

     Woke up to jazz seizing.  Pretty standard.  Gave him 2 pills as soon as he could swallow in hopes to stop the cluster before it starts.

     Wasn't home to see it.  Pretty sure he had one.

     Hit as he was sleeping. Followed up by 2 pills as soon as he could swallow.

#### October 1, 2014 4:23 AM

     Again.  Not giving more more meds. Dunno how much us too much. Later during the day (post dinner timer), Sydney was trying to be dominant with jazz. Nothing came of it.

#### October 2, 2014 15:10

     That one was a surprise. Had Been More than 24 hrs. Gave him a pill and    tried to give the rectal medicine.  Not sure how much if any he got. Was   wiggling around too much.

#### December 14, 2014

     Looks like were Shooting for a record.  It's been warmer the last couple of days and his coat has filled in from the summer hair cut. Both Jazz and Sydney have been panting more.  See what the weather does and maybe just maybe do a trim or a cut we'll see.

#### December 23, 2014 21:03

     Was a fast one.  Lasted a minute or less. As soon as he could swallow he got 2 pills. After the ice cream. It seems to cool him off and replace some sugar.  It curbs the hyper-ness that usually follows. He is being very clutsy at the moment.

#### December 24, 2014 5:32

     About the same as last nite.  Just hit while we were all sleeping. Gave 1  extra pill and followed normal dose at regular time.

#### December 25, 2014 13:00

     Didn't witness it, was in the shower. Found him bumping into stuff as I got out.  Gave ice cream,  no pill. See how it goes.

#### December 25, 2014 12:30

#### December 25, 2014 7:16

     Nothing new.

#### December 25, 2014 13:00

#### December 26, 2014

     Didn't see his face , but i think maybe he had a mini seizure.  Saw his head and ears shake like a seizure.  To be safe we gave him 1 pill.

### 2015

#### January 9, 2015

     Note about Jazz being odd today, Not Sleeping much and just sitting staring at us. Also being extra cuddly and clumsy

#### February 15, 2015 12:56 AM

     That was unexpected. Very standard. About 1 minuet is seizure back on his feet in 4 gave some Ice Cream followed by a pill.  Settled down at 1:29AM

     About 1 Minuet seizure  Back to normal in 4 minuets later.

#### September 6, 2015 9:43 AM

     Pretty intense one. Actually seizure about 1 min Back on his fee in 6 min,  Working off the adrenaline  gave 2 pills

### 2016

    No Seizure to make note of

#### February 23, 2016

     Had a Vet Appointment to get Jazzy's lump checked out and it was decided to reduce his medication from 3 pills twice a day to 2 pills twice a day.  Last seizure was back in September.   Since then he has been more active, bright eyed, and playful.

#### June 20, 2016 8:55 PM

     That was a complete surprise.  Lasted 3-4 minuets til he was responsive and interactive again.  Gave ice cream and then another pill in hopes of stopping the cluster before it starts.  Only thing remotely odd, thinking back, is that he was ravenous  Searching for any morsel of food after he ate his food

#### June 21, 2016 6:01 AM

     Almost made it through the night without a seizure.  Pretty standard one.  Upped his bed from 2 pill to 3 this morning.

#### June 22, 2016 4:25 AM

     Almost made it to the 24hour mark

#### June 22, 2016 7:07 AM

     And yet another one.  It hit as he was sleeping and he fell off the bed.. He is ok he didn't hurt himself

#### July 2, 2016 11:56 PM

     That was unexpected.  Very usual seizure.  Gave 2 pills as follow up instead of 1 in hopes it would stop the cluster before it starts

### 2017

#### March 8, 2017

     Scheduled for Surgery.  He had a softball sized fatty lump removed from his left side.  Also had a dental cleaning which found 2 bat teeth that were removed.  No Seizures.

#### April 26, 2017 7:15 AM

     Well, I guess that answered that.  We (doctor and us) had reduced his meds to 150mg Zonisamide twice a day and 1k-Bro once a day  New med dosage has been in place for about a week and he had a seizure this morning.  Yes it was a grand Maul but not very long or hard  Jazz recovered very fast and was given 100mg zonisamide after the seizure.

#### April 27, 2017 1:10 AM

     It Hit while sleeping

#### April 27, 2017 5:55 AM

     Same as last nite.  Gave meds around 6 200mg Zonisamide.  instead of waiting till 7AM

#### April 27, 2017 3:55 PM

     Was A bit unexpected.  He was sleeping in the living room and it hit.  Followed up with Ice Cream and 100 mg Zonisimide.

#### May 12, 2017 11:35 PM

     that was a surprise.  It hit as he was asleep, as usual.  Followed up with Ice Cream Then 1 Zonisimide and 1 K-Bro after he went out to crap

#### May 13, 2017 11:48 AM

     Thought we were out of the woods but no, not su much No Extra meds given this time.  Just normal dose at 7am  Sure seems that Jazz spikes Seizures in the spring.  The grass pollen has been very high for about a month.

#### May 13, 2017 10:00 PM

     We had gone out to the movies and Mom was watching them.  She saild he was restless most of the time we were gone.  when he settled down and went to sleep is when it happened.  Only twice, out of all his seizures,  they happend as he was awake.  Right now he's still burning off the adrenaline.  Gave 1 more Zonisimide when we got home in addition to his regular doese at 7:00PM  Hopefully this is the last entry for a while.

#### May 14, 2017 12:57 AM

     so Much for that theory.  The only common factor is the grass pollen counts have been off the charts for few days.  the other weird thing Thursday nite, he went out around 9 something did his things and came back in.  Later his left eye upper lid was swollen like a bug bite or sting.  And then within a few hours he had a seizure.  So if the sting on bug bite was responsible for this cluster we should be good soon.  Things are almost back to normal

#### May 15, 2017 Update

     so far so good,  Jazz has energy to burn so we took him to the K-9 Country Club  (peanut too) and let them burn off some of the energy

#### September 19, 2017 1:02 AM

     That was a surprise.  That is happened.  Allthought marty had noticed Jazzy weird breath smell yesterday morning while they were playing.  No Odd behaviour though.  Just happy go lucky Jazz.  Didn't have any Ice Cream so he go 2 pills (total 200mg)  of zonisimide in hopes it would stop the cluster before it really gets going

#### September 19, 2017  5:36 AM

     And Another one.  No Extra meds at this time.  Wait for the dose at 7am.  Going to up the dosage to 200mg twice a day for a bit.

#### September 19, 2017 10:56 PM

     Well that was very unusual.  He was walking, so he was wide awake, and just fell over into a grand maul seizure.  gave some vanilla Ice Cream and 100mg Zonisimde as soon as he couls swallow.  that pust him at 3 seizures in less than 24 hours  The only thing that was different in the last few days was the vet visit on the 15th to get the check up and with the check up the k-9 influenza up the nose as part of the requrements for dog park entry

#### September 20, 2017 8:36 AM

     We made it through the nite w/o seizure. He actually selp on the bed most of the nite.  Jazz woke me up around 3 to go out.  Then we got up around 7.  did the potty break and meds 200mg He finally settled down around 8:00 or 8:15.  So again in deep sleep it happened.  Grand Maul, lasted about 2 min  gave Ice Cream and an additional 50 mg  This time he had the vocal adrenaline dump.  In Theroy he shoudl be done with this cluster the next 24 houros will let us know.

#### September 20, 2017 12:556 AM

     Wow Poor Baby,  That was #5 No Extra Meds given I wonder if the pollen count and / or higher Temperature have to do with this.  so he got a bath keep him cooler

#### November 15th 14:30

     Just got home and pretty sure he had a seizure all the tell tale signs.  The wet beard down one side.  The under belly soaked in pee,  The pee puddle where he had the seizure, and finally the adrenaline dump.  No Idea why he had one today. the meds 2x 100mg  1 k-bro  hasn't changed.  On the 10 they both had their sentinal like every month.  Lets hope this is the only one.. "Fingers Crossed"

#### November 15th 19:36

#### November 16th 20:14

     M- Almost exactly 25 hours from the last.   he must have just dozed off cause I was in the bathroom and he just re-located from the living room to the hall way right before I went to the bathroom.
