Updated Docs

Created the base SOPâ€™s and I still need to migrate the client use and troubleshooting admin sop  as well as a reference for all the time sources.  I have found that the time sources are incorrect (or at least they look that way to me) for the US-EAST-1 region

I still need to write up the Nagios alert sops for the 3 different monitors
